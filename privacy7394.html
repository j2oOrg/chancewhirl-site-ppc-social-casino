            <p style="color: #e0e0e0; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, data analysis, customer service, email delivery, marketing assistance, and payment processing. These service providers are contractually obligated to use your information only as necessary to provide services to us and are required to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">4.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
            <p style="color: #e0e0e0; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities, such as a court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We may also disclose your information when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with legal obligations.
            </p>

            <p style="color: #e0e0e0; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
            </p>

            <h2 style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 28px; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">5. Data Security</h2>
            <p style="color: #e0e0e0; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

            </p>
            <p style="color: #e0e0e0; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for any activities that occur under your account.

            </p>
            <p style="color: #e0e0e0; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you, whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, and whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as regarding applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).
            </p>
